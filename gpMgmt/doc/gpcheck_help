*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

The gpcheck utility determines the platform on which you are running 
Greenplum Database and validates various platform-specific configuration 
settings. gpcheck can use a host file or a file previously created with 
the --zipout option to validate platform settings. At the end of a 
successful validation process, GPCHECK_NORMAL message displays. If 
GPCHECK_ERROR displays, one or more validation checks failed. You can 
use also gpcheck to gather and view platform settings on hosts without 
running validation checks. 

Greenplum recommends that you run gpcheck as root. If you do not run 
gpcheck as root, the utility displays a warning message and will not be 
able to validate all configuration settings; Only some of these settings 
will be validated. 


*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

--config <config_file>

 The name of a configuration file to use instead of the default file 
 $GPHOME/etc/gpcheck.cnf. This file specifies the OS-specific checks to 
 run. 


{-f | --file} <hostfile_gpcheck> 

 The name of a file that contains a list of hosts that gpcheck uses to 
 validate platform-specific settings. This file should contain a single 
 host name for all hosts in your Greenplum Database system (master, 
 standby master, and segments). gpcheck uses SSH to connect to the hosts. 


{--h | --host} <host_ID> 

 Checks platform-specific settings on the host in your Greenplum Database 
 system specified by <host_ID>. gpcheck uses SSH to connect to the host. 


--local 

 Checks platform-specific settings on the segment host where gpcheck is 
 run. This option does not require SSH authentication. 


-m <master_host> 

 This option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. 


-s <standby_master_host>

 This option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. 


--stdout 

 Display collected host information from gpcheck. No checks or 
 validations are performed. 


--zipout 

 Save all collected data to a .zip file in the current working directory. 
 gpcheck automatically creates the .zip file and names it 
 gpcheck_<timestamp>.tar.gz. No checks or validations are performed. 


--zipin <gpcheck_zipfile> 

 Use this option to decompress and check a .zip file created with the 
 --zipout option. gpcheck performs validation tasks against the file you 
 specify in this option. 


-? (help) 

 Displays the online help. 


--version 

 Displays the version of this utility. 


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Verify and validate the Greenplum Database platform settings by entering 
a host file: 

 # gpcheck -f hostfile_gpcheck 

Save Greenplum Database platform settings to a zip file: 

 # gpcheck -f hostfile_gpcheck --zipout 

Verify and validate the Greenplum Database platform settings using a zip 
file created with the --zipout option: 

 # gpcheck --zipin gpcheck_timestamp.tar.gz 

View collected Greenplum Database platform settings: 

 # gpcheck -f hostfile_gpcheck --stdout
