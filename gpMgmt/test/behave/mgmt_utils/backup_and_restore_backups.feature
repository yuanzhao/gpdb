    Scenario: 142 gpcrondump -u option with include table filtering
        Given the backup test is initialized with database "bkdb142"
        And there is a "ao" table "public.ao_table" in "bkdb142" with data
        And there is a "co" table "public.co_table" in "bkdb142" with data
        And there is a "heap" table "public.heap_table" in "bkdb142" with data
        And there is a file "include_file" with tables "public.ao_table|public.heap_table"
        When the user runs "gpcrondump -a -x bkdb142 --table-file include_file -u /tmp"
        And gpcrondump should return a return code of 0
        And the timestamp from gpcrondump is stored
        And all the data from "bkdb142" is saved for verification

    Scenario: 143 gpcrondump -u option with exclude table filtering
        Given the backup test is initialized with database "bkdb143"
        And there is a "ao" table "public.ao_table" in "bkdb143" with data
        And there is a "co" table "public.co_table" in "bkdb143" with data
        And there is a "heap" table "public.heap_table" in "bkdb143" with data
        And there is a file "exclude_file" with tables "public.ao_table|public.heap_table"
        When the user runs "gpcrondump -a -x bkdb143 --exclude-table-file exclude_file -u /tmp"
        And gpcrondump should return a return code of 0
        And the timestamp from gpcrondump is stored
        And all the data from "bkdb143" is saved for verification

    Scenario: 144 gpdbrestore -u option with include table filtering
        Given the backup test is initialized with database "bkdb144"
        And there is a "ao" table "public.ao_table" in "bkdb144" with data
        And there is a "co" table "public.co_table" in "bkdb144" with data
        When the user runs "gpcrondump -a -x bkdb144 -u /tmp"
        And gpcrondump should return a return code of 0
        And the timestamp from gpcrondump is stored
        And all the data from "bkdb144" is saved for verification

    Scenario: 145 gpcrondump with -u and --prefix option
        Given the backup test is initialized with database "bkdb145"
        And the prefix "foo" is stored
        And the database "bkdb1452" does not exist
        And there is a "heap" table "public.heap_table" in "bkdb145" with data
        And there is a "ao" partition table "public.ao_part_table" in "bkdb145" with data
        And a backup file of tables "public.heap_table, public.ao_part_table" in "bkdb145" exists for validation
        When the user runs "gpcrondump -a -x bkdb145 --prefix=foo -u /tmp"
        Then gpcrondump should return a return code of 0
        And the timestamp from gpcrondump is stored
