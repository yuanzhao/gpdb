  <title>About Management and Monitoring Utilities</title>
  <shortdesc>Greenplum Database provides standard command-line utilities for performing common
    monitoring and administration tasks. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Greenplum command-line utilities are located in the
        <filepath><varname>$GPHOME</varname>/bin</filepath> directory and are executed on the master
      host. Greenplum provides utilities for the following administration tasks:</p>
    <ul id="ul_mtm_tsv_fp">
      <li>Installing Greenplum Database on an array</li>
      <li>Initializing a Greenplum Database System</li>
      <li>Starting and stopping Greenplum Database</li>
      <li>Adding or removing a host</li>
      <li>Expanding the array and redistributing tables among new segments</li>
      <li>Managing recovery for failed segment instances</li>
      <li>Managing failover and recovery for a failed master instance</li>
      <li>Backing up and restoring a database (in parallel)</li>
      <li>Loading data in parallel</li>
      <li>Transferring data between Greenplum databases</li>
      <li>System state reporting</li>
    </ul>
    <p otherprops="pivotal">Pivotal provides an optional system monitoring and management tool,
      Greenplum Command Center, which administrators can install and enable with Greenplum Database.
      Greenplum Command Center depends upon a dedicated database in Greenplum Database, named
        <codeph>gpperfmon</codeph>, which is used to collect and store system metrics. Data
      collection agents on the segments send their data to the Greenplum master at regular intervals
      (typically every 15 seconds).</p>
    <p> Greenplum Database includes a <codeph>gpperfmon_install</codeph> management utility,
      which creates the <codeph>gpperfmon</codeph> database and enables the data
      collection agents. Users can query the <codeph>gpperfmon</codeph> database to see
      query and system metrics. </p>
    <p otherprops="pivotal">Administrators can install Greenplum Command Center, available
      separately from Greenplum Database, to provide a graphical web-based user interface for
      viewing the system metrics and to perform additional system management tasks. For more
      information about Greenplum Command Center, see the <xref href="https://gpcc.docs.pivotal.io"
