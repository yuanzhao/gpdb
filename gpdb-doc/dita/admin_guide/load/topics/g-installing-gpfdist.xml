   <title>Installing gpfdist</title>
   <body>
      <p>
            <cmdname>gpfdist</cmdname> is installed in <codeph>$GPHOME/bin</codeph> of your
            Greenplum Database master host installation. Run <cmdname>gpfdist</cmdname>
            on a machine other than the Greenplum Database master or standby master, such as on a
            machine devoted to ETL processing. Running <cmdname>gpfdist</cmdname> on the
            master or standby master can have a performance impact on query execution.
            To install <cmdname>gpfdist</cmdname> on your ETL server, get it from the
            <i>Greenplum Load Tools</i> package and follow its installation instructions.</p>
