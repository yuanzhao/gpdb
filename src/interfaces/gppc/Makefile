# GPPC is ready to build against installed backend, so that we can try it
# against different backend releases without switching source tree.
# This means GPPC should build and work with older releases without
# source modified and we need to keep it identical between different
# backend release branches.
# We achieve to build with another backend release by PGXS. Everything
# GPPC needs (i.e. headers and makefiles) are installed along with pg_config.
