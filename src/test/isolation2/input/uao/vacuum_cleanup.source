-- @Description Test that when there is a parallel vacuum going on in drop phase, the age of
-- the AO/AOCS table gets reduced correctly.

1: create table ao_@orientation@_vacuum_cleanup1(a int, b int) with(appendonly=true, orientation=@orientation@);
1: insert into ao_@orientation@_vacuum_cleanup1 select 1, i from generate_series(1, 100) i;
1: update ao_@orientation@_vacuum_cleanup1 set b = b + 1;

-- The age of the table is 1 after the following statement
2: create table ao_@orientation@_vacuum_cleanup2(a int, b int) with(appendonly=true, orientation=@orientation@);
-- The age of the table is 2 after the following statement
2: insert into ao_@orientation@_vacuum_cleanup2 select 1, i from generate_series(1, 100) i;
-- The age of the table is 3 after the following statement
